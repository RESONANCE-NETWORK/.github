# RESONANCE.NETWORK / RESONANCE-NETWORK

Welcome to the RESONANCE.NETWORK organization!  
This page gives an overview of who we are, what we build, and how you can get involved.

## üåê About RESONANCE.NETWORK

**RESONANCE.NETWORK** (aka **RESONANCE.NETWORKS** / **Project Resonance**) is a community and development hub focused on immersive **roleplay (RP) gaming experiences** across multiple game universes.  
Through custom servers and narrative-rich environments, we aim to deliver deep, persuasive roleplay systems and dynamic immersive worlds.  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

On our official site, you can see that we currently host (or plan to host) the following RP universes:  
- **Half-Life: Alyx RP** ‚Äî Set in a dystopian future, players can assume roles like citizens, resistance fighters, or Cartel agents in a system with economy, events, and customization. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **SCP Roleplay** ‚Äî A lore-driven server where the Foundation, agents, anomalies, and D-Class characters interact in containment, breach, and covert settings. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **SWTOR Roleplay** (in development) ‚Äî Bringing Star Wars lore into a roleplay context: political intrigue, exploration, faction conflicts, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

We believe in **player agency, emergent storylines, and systems that support immersion** (economies, events, choices, etc.). The community around RESONANCE is built by both players and developers working together.

## üìÇ Organization Purpose & Structure

This GitHub organization is intended to host:

- Server source code (game mods, plugins, backends)  
- Shared frameworks and libraries we use across RP servers  
- Tools for community management, event systems, modding support  
- Documentation, tutorials, and guides for contributors  
- Assets, scripts, and APIs (where licensing allows)  

As of now, we don‚Äôt have public repositories yet (per GitHub display). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} But this README is a starting point to present our projects more clearly to contributors, collaborators, or prospective players.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To contribute or get involved:

1. **Explore our public repos** (coming soon) ‚Äî check for repos like `rl-server`, `rl-plugins`, `common-library`, `frontend-dashboard`, etc.
2. Read **CONTRIBUTING.md** (once available) for guidelines on coding style, testing, PR process.
3. Join our **Discord / community channels** (linked on the website) to discuss features, lore, or server events.
4. Check our **roadmap** or **issues** to see what tasks or features need work.
5. Respect our **code of conduct / rules** (to be published) ‚Äî we‚Äôre building a friendly, inclusive community.

## üéØ Vision & Goals

- Build **immersive RP universes** where player decisions influence the world  
- Maintain clean, modular, reusable code across all servers  
- Enable **community-driven storytelling** via quests, events, lore expansions  
- Support cross-server tools (e.g. identity system, economies, governance)  
- Eventually open source or partially open parts of infrastructure  
- Expand to more universes and support multiple RP platforms

## üîß Tech Stack (Tentative / Evolving)

This will depend on the server types, but possible components include:

- Game server mods / plugins (e.g. for Source, Unity, Unreal)  
- Backend APIs (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)  
- Databases (SQL / NoSQL)  
- Web frontend or dashboards  
- Scripting / event engines  
- Asset pipelines, version control, CI/CD

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & TODO

- We should publish a **roadmap** or project vision doc  
- Add **public repos** and move internal code into ‚Äúcore‚Äù, ‚Äúplugin‚Äù, ‚Äútools‚Äù etc.  
- Add **documentation**, **architecture diagrams**, and **onboarding guides**  
- Define **license(s)** for shared code and assets  
- Provide **style guides**, **API docs**, and **examples** for contributors
