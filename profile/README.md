## üåê About RESONANCE. NETWORK

**RESONANCE. NETWORK** (aka **Project : R√©sonance**) is a community focused on immersive **roleplay (RP) gaming experiences** across multiple game universes.  
Through custom servers and narrative-rich environments, we aim to deliver deep, persuasive roleplay systems and dynamic immersive worlds.  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

On our official site, you can see that we currently host (or plan to host) the following RP universes:  
- **Half-Life: Alyx RP** ‚Äî Set in a dystopian future, players can assume roles like citizens, resistance fighters, or Cartel agents in a system with economy, events, and customization. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **SCP Roleplay** (in development) ‚Äî A lore-driven server where the Foundation, agents, anomalies, and D-Class characters interact in containment, breach, and covert settings. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **SWTOR Roleplay** (in development) ‚Äî Bringing Star Wars lore into a roleplay context: political intrigue, exploration, faction conflicts, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

We believe in **player agency, emergent storylines, and systems that support immersion** (economies, events, choices, etc.). The community around RESONANCE is built by both players and developers working together.
