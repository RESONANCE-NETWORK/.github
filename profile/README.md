## 🌐 About RESONANCE.NETWORK

**RESONANCE.NETWORK** (also known as **Project : Résonance**) is a creative community dedicated to immersive **roleplay (RP) gaming experiences** across multiple universes.  
Through custom servers, narrative-rich environments, and carefully designed systems, we aim to deliver deep, meaningful roleplay opportunities and dynamic, living worlds.  

On our official site, you can explore the RP universes we host or are developing:

- **Half-Life: Alyx RP** — Set in a dystopian future, players can live as citizens, resistance fighters, or Cartel agents within an evolving system of economy, events, and customization.  
- **SCP Roleplay** *(in development)* — A lore-driven universe where Foundation personnel, anomalies, and D-Class subjects clash in containment, breach, and covert scenarios.  
- **SWTOR Roleplay** *(in development)* — Bringing the vast Star Wars galaxy into an RP context, full of political intrigue, faction conflict, and exploration.  

We believe in **player agency, emergent storytelling, and systems that amplify immersion**. Our community thrives on collaboration between players, storytellers, and developers.
